## Development

This section will help you build a basic VitePress documentation site.

> Warning:
> VitePress is currently in alpha status. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box documentation use, but the config and theming API may still change between minor releases.

## Boot up dev environment

Serve the documentation site in the local server.

```sh
yarn docs:dev
```

VitePress will start a hot-reloading development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

See https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/getting-started.html for more information.
